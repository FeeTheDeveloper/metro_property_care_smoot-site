        <h2>About Metro</h2>
        <p>
          <strong>Metro Property Care</strong> is the dedicated e‑commerce and national distribution
          extension for Icon Iron Rail—bringing proven fabrication quality from Detroit to
          contractors, builders and property professionals across the United States.
        </p>
        <p>
          We operate as a third‑party subcontracted partner so that Icon Iron Rail can
          focus on fabrication and local storefront transactions.  Metro extends access
          to their product line beyond the local market.  We sell iron products and building
          components by part through a streamlined online store, with reliable packaging,
          shipping coordination, and contractor‑friendly ordering—so projects stay on
          schedule.
