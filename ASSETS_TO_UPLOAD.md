# Assets to Upload (Manual Step)

Upload these files manually to the repo (outside Codex PR), in the correct folder:

1) `logo.png` -> `assets/logo.png`
2) `background.png` -> `assets/background.png`
3) `flat-lay.jpg` (optional) -> `assets/flat-lay.jpg`

After uploading, verify images load (no other changes required).
